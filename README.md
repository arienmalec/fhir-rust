# FHIR Rust Implementation

[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) seems the perfect language with which to implement [FHIR](https://hl7-fhir.github.io), because Rust is simply slow burning fire :)

This is the code following my [series of blog posts](http://arienmalec.github.io/implementing-fhir/) about implementing FHIR. Don't expect the code to do anything useful now (if ever).
